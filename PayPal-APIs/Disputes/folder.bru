  Occasionally, something goes wrong with a customer's order. To dispute a charge, a customer can create a dispute with PayPal. PayPal merchants, partners, and external developers can use the PayPal Disputes API to manage customer disputes.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In the live environment, merchants cannot create disputes but can only respond to customer-created disputes. However, merchants can create disputes in the sandbox environment. When you create an app, enable Disputes in the App feature options section.</blockquote>A customer can also ask his or her bank or credit card company to dispute and reverse a charge, which is known as a <i>chargeback</i>. For more information, see <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/customer-disputes-claims-chargebacks-bank-reversals">Disputes, claims, chargebacks, and bank reversals</a>.<br/><br/>When a customer disputes a charge, you can use this API to provide evidence that the charge is legitimate. To provide evidence or appeal a dispute, you submit a proof of delivery or proof of refund document or notes, which can include logs.<br/><br/>Normally, an agent at PayPal creates a dispute, updates the dispute status, and settles disputes, but now you can run test cases in the sandbox that complete these operations.<br/><br/><blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> The create, cancel, compute metrics, change reason, and validate eligibility methods are available as a limited-release solution at this time. For more information, reach out to your PayPal account manager.</blockquote><br/>For details, see <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/disputes/#link-customerdisputes">Disputes Overview</a> documentation.
