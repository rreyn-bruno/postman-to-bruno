  Provides supporting information for a dispute, by ID. A merchant or buyer can make this request for disputes if they find the `provide-supporting-info` link in the HATEOAS links in the list disputes response. The party can provide the supporting information to PayPal to defend themselves only when the `dispute_life_cycle_stage` is `CHARGEBACK`, `PRE_ARBITRATION`, or `ARBITRATION`. They can provide a note that describes their part with details or upload any supporting documents to support their side. The following rules apply to document file types and sizes:<ul><li>The party can upload up to 50 MB of files for a case.</li><li>Individual files must be smaller than 10 MB.</li><li>The supported file formats are JPG, GIF, PNG, and PDF.</li></ul><br/>To make this request, specify the dispute ID in the URI and specify the notes in the JSON request body. This method differs from the provide evidence method which supports only multipart request, where PayPal asks the concerned party for evidence.
