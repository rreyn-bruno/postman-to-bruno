  You can use billing plans and subscriptions to create subscriptions that process recurring PayPal payments for physical or digital goods, or services. A plan includes pricing and billing cycle information that defines the amount and frequency of charge for a subscription. You can also define a fixed plan, such as a $5 basic plan or a volume- or graduated-based plan with pricing tiers based on the quantity purchased. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/subscriptions/">Subscriptions Overview</a>.
