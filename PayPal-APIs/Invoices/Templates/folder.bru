  Use the `/templates` resource to create, list, show details for, update, and delete invoice templates. Use the `/templates` resource when you create a third-party invoicing application. For instance, a business can create a template with predefined invoice data. Later, the business can select the template to populate the invoice data.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> To upload a logo to display on an invoice, you can use the <strong>Template Settings</strong> dashboard to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/invoice/settings/templates">create a template</a>. When you create an invoice, you can use the URI for that logo.</blockquote>
