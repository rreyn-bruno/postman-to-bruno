  > **Important:** PayPal for Partners is a limited-release solution at this time. It is available to select partners for approved use cases. For more information, reach out to your PayPal account manager or [contact us](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/partner-program/contact-us). 
    
  
  The Managed Accounts API enables a PayPal account holder to manage multiple PayPal accounts. These accounts are non-loginable, and the availability of the following REST API methods to create and manage these accounts is limited to partners who are approved for the Managed path solution.
  
  Use the `/managed-accounts` resource to create managed accounts, show managed account details, partially update managed accounts, and show status for in-progress and completed asynchronous requests.
  
  In this Postman Collection, an access token is automatically generated using the provided default `managed_path_client_id` and `managed_path_client_secret`. PayPal recommends using your own `client_id` and `client_secret` from developer portal and use them in `managed_path_client_id` and `managed_path_client_secret` under the **Variables** tab. A pre-request script will generate and manage the `managed_path_access_token`automatically.
  
  > **Note:** Your developer account `managed_path_client_id` and `managed_path_client_secret` may have a different scope and organization than the default `managed_path_client_id` and `managed_path_client_secret`. The managed-path merchant account may also have different capabilities and process views than the merchant account generated by the default one.
