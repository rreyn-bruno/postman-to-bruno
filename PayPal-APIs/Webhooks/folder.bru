  The PayPal REST APIs use <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/webhooks/"/>webhooks</a> for event notification. Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that receive notification messages for events. After you configure a webhook listener for your app, you can <a href="#webhooks_create">create a webhook</a>, which subscribes the webhook listener for your app to events. The <code>notifications</code> namespace contains resource collections for webhooks.
